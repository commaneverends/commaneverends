Comma Never Ends is a interactive platform that is collecting/publishing female* artists and critical thinkers in music, literature and film, it therefore is creating a virtual space for more diverse traces/evidences of women* in arts. 
We want to show the multidimensional features of being female*, which is not just being vulnerable, soft, kind, smiling, sensitive, caring, helpful, dedicated, warm - but also strong, powerful, straight, direct, high esteem/self confident, skilled, insightful, ambitious, intellectual, loud, problematic and rude. 

This platform  is interactive, which means that everyone can submit ideas or artists, that are not included in our lists yet. 
Furthermore this website is providing 
a network for local feminist* groups in Berlin
a event planner for feminist* events in Berlin
a feminist* Map of Berlin with like minded places (and parties with awareness teams)
