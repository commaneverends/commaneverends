<h1>About CommaNeverEnds</h1>

The idea is to create a space for FLINTA* persons, to connect with each other and to gather information about FLINTA* art - for a  greater visibility of FLINTA* persons.<br>
The current status of the website is a rough sketch of the platform and archive that we would like to build with your participation. We set up the environment for a archive/platform and you can contribute by sending us FLINTA* artists, events and places: <br>
We implemented a contact sheet on each branch of the archive, just write down your recommendations, press the button “submit” and we will add your recommendations to the archive!<br>

The Website contains an archive with a collection of FLINTA* artists and a networking platform: <br>

<h2>ARCHIVE</h2>

<h2>PLATFORM </h2>

<h3>Event Calendar </h3>
Even before corona we were planning to set up a calendar for flinta events. A calendar helps to keep an overview about meetings, networking opportunities and academic discourses, as well as practical political action like protests or spontaneous meet ups of FLINTA*.
It's even more difficult to stay connected and to show solidarity and to support each other in times of Corona. Therefore it is even more important to stay connected in the virtual world and to participate in online meetings - Therefore the current version of the calendar is mainly showing online events.

<h1> Manifesto </h1>

We need to see more diverse presence/trace/evidences of FLINTA* persons in the aspects of our lives. <br>
We want to show multidimensional features of being women, lesbian, intersex, non-binary, trans* and agender. <br>
We are not just vulnerable, soft, kind, smiling, sensitive, caring, helpful, dedicated, patient, warm, emotional, sexual, but also strong, powerful, straight, direct, high-esteem/self-confident, skilled, insightful, gentle, ambitious, intellectual, loud, problematic (making problems observable from hidden/silent system) and have flaws naturally. All of these are part of us, which should be accepted without any additional explanations or justifications. <br><br>

We, as a part of FLINTA* persons, seek to build a space, which present the heterogeneous features of FLINTA* persons in the aspects of our cultural lives. <br>
We are collecting the information related to music, literature, and film created by FLINTA* persons, and making them visible on this platform. <br><br>

We are, currently, a group of individuals who are talking, writing, and making this platform together.<br>
We are dreaming of commaneverends to be a space for the collective of individuals across people*space*generations, who are creating new connections, facilitating/strengthening those connections, and extending/supporting them based on love and respect.<br><br>

We are now talking to you by presenting this first version of commaneverends (a baby!), and we are waiting for your reply. <br>
We would like to see you and hear from you, so tell us what you think, what you feel, how you are, or what you want to do.<br><br><br>


as long as you remember<br>
<span  style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">, neverends. </span><br>
