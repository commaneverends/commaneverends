<h1>Comma Never Ends</h1>
Comma Never Ends is a interactive platform that is collecting and publishing female* artists and critical thinkers in music, literature and film, therefore it is creating a virtual space for more diverse traces and evidence of women* in arts. 
&nbsp;
We want to show the multidimensional features of being female*, which is not just being vulnerable, soft, kind, smiling, sensitive, caring, helpful, dedicated, warm - but also strong, powerful, straight, direct, high esteem/self confident, skilled, insightful, ambitious, intellectual, loud, problematic and rude. 
&nbsp;
This platform  is interactive, which means that everyone can submit ideas or artists, that are not included in our lists yet. It is a list that <strong>never ends</strong> and it keeps growing if we share our knowledge with each other! 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<h1>Furthermore this website is providing </h1>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<li> a network for local feminist* groups in Berlin</li>
<li>a event planner for feminist* events in Berlin</li>
<li>a feminist* Map of Berlin with like minded places</li>
</ul>
