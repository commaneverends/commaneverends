Kali Feminists,https://kalifeminists.wordpress.com/,"We are Feminists rise up/Feminist rebellion, a political group that has been formed during the strike of student employees in early 2018 for a new tariff agreement (TVStud 3) in Berlin and that wants to stand together for the legalization of abortions in Germany. With the campaign „strike away §218 and §219a“ we will continue to mobilize against the criminalization of abortions. The discussions that we have had since our first meeting and the participation in feminist and anti-capitalist actions have led us to write this manifesto. From the beginning it was clear that the fight against the abortion paragraphs meant much more than standing up for women*’s rights. Our feminism means to question all power relations."
Women in Exile & Friends,https://www.women-in-exile.net/,"Women in Exile is an initiative of refugee women founded in Brandenburg in 2002 by refugee women to fight for their rights. We decided to organize as a refugee women’s group because we have made the experience that refugee women are doubly discriminated against not only by racist laws and discriminative refugee laws in general but also as women. The struggle against these laws is usually supported by mixed-sex refugee self-organizations and in our experience, these are often dominated by men who look at other issues as more important. Women in Exile e.V. was founded in Potsdam in 2011 and is recognized as a non-profit association."
