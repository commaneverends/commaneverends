# Welcome to comma never ends!
We are collecting female* artists in music, literature and film to build a space for women* in arts.
Comma Never Ends is an interactive archive, you can add your favourite artists.
Our archive consists of three main categories: music, literature and film.
There are so many interesting female* artists, together we can keep this archive growing - so it never ends, lets connect!


{% highlight ruby %}
def archive_your(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
archive_your('Carol')
#=> prints 'Hi, Carol' to easy-living.
{% endhighlight %}
