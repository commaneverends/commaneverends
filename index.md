# Welcome to comma never ends!

We are collecting female* artists in music, literature and film to build a space for women* in arts. 
Comma Never Ends is an interactive archive, you can add your favourite artists. 
Our archive consists of three main categories: music, literature and film. 
There are so many interesting female* artists, together we can keep this archive growing - so it never ends, lets connect!
